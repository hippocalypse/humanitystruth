        <p>Mainstream education has lied to all of us. You feel it in your core, but why? If we as a species are to overcome this systemic tyranny, we must understand it. In fact, it's this very ignorance that plagues humanity.</p>
        
           
            
        <p>The Lightworkers Union is a collective of free-thinking minds. 
           We're developing an open-source investigative research and development community. 
           Securely distributing suppressed technology that the global elite
           work hard to silence is our profession.
           
           Here's some of our Lightworker's Union app features:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>hybrid p2p filesharing system for humanitystruth evidence</li>
            <li>mining-for-hire system to utilize idle processing, bandwidth, and virtual hard-drive space</li>
            <li>critical suppressed evidence gets pushed/shared throughout network</li>
            <li>transparent open-source community, with multiple layers of file redundancy</li>
            <li>financing sourced from mining-for-hire operations further fund whistleblowers and suppressed evidence</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Some examples of the suppressed intelligence we risk life and liberty to expose:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Zero-Point Energy</li>
            <li>Electro/Magneto Gravitics</li>
            <li>Permanent Magnet Pulsed Motor/Generators</li>
            <li>Consciousness-based Technology</li>
            <li>Crystal/Quasi-Crystalline Technologies</li>
            <li>Exo-politics/news</li>
            <li>Resonance/Harmonic Frequencies</li>
            <li>Advanced Pharmaceuticals</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You may support bringing truth to mass-consciousness in a few ways:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Join our Lightworkers Union and support the truth with file-persistence plus idle processing, bandwidth, and virtual disk space.<br>
                (You'll even earn yourself and your preferred investigations coin if you choose to mine crypto)</li>
            <li>Financially support the community with a small donation to HumanitysTruth!</li>
            <li>Join our developers forums and help build various open-source plugins needed for our system.</li>
            <li>If you've got some suppressed technology and are seeking a publishing outlet: Utilize our anonymous submission system.</li>
            <li>Expand your education daily, the truth is only for those who actively seek it. (Joining our community is a great start!)</li>
            <li>Transition away from specializing in a particular subject and executing the same logical process daily. This is how ignorance is bred.</li>
        </ol>
