These messages are the only way we will be able to reach you. Write this down on a piece of paper and never store it digitally.

                    <h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
                    <p>If you have any issues, talk to HumanitysTruth. We are global experts in source protection â€“ it's a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="alert alert-info">
                    <h4>2. Act normal</h4>
                    <p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="alert alert-info">
                    <h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
                    <p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
                    <p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
                    <p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>

                <div class="alert alert-info">
                    <h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
                    <p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources.
