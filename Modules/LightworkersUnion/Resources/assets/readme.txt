This is where I'm collecting the framework for the Lightworkers Union app.

It's going to utilize open-source packages to begin:

tor and encryption, (orchid - java)
hybrid p2p implementation (hive2hive - java)
miner, for mining-for-hire implementation (xmr-stak - c++)

We want to build these together for our mechanism 
of suppressed file submission, file persistence, 
individual security, and financial promotion of 
said suppressed files.
